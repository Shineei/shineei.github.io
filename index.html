    <h1>Snoopy Returns from Artemis I Mission</h1>
    <p>
      Inside the lobby of the Neil Armstrong Operations and Checkout Building at
      NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida, Snoopy, the zero-gravity indicator
      that flew aboard Orion during the <strong>Artemis I mission</strong>, is
      shown on Jan. 5, 2023, after being unpacked from his transport case.

      was secured inside Orion during the Artemis I mission, a journey beyond
      the Moon and back to prepare for crewed missions to the Moon. Artemis I
      launched atop the Space Launch System rocket on Nov. 16, 2022 from
      Kennedy’s Launch Complex 39B. Orion returned to Earth for a splashdown in
      the Pacific Ocean on Dec. 11, 2022 after traveling more than 1.4 million
      miles. NASA has held an association with <strong>Snoopy</strong> since the
      Apollo Era – the character has contributed to the excitement for NASA
      human spaceflight missions, helping inspire generations to dream big, and
      is a symbol of NASA’s safety culture and mission success.
